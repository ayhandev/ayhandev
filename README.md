# 👋 Hello, I'm @ayhandev or just Ayhan

😄 I am 15 years old (turning 16 soon)  

🙂 I am a web developer, I can write code in HTML, CSS, and a little JS, and my backend is Python/Django.  

👍 Among the frameworks I know Bootstrap, Bulma and Django for the backend.  

👀 I am also interested in music, I can play the piano and clarinet, and I go in for sports.  

🌱 Now I'm in 11th grade, I'll graduate from school in a year and want to continue the path of a programmer✌️  

💞️ I can collaborate on web development.  

I will always be happy to help you if you need help, thanks for reading about me😁
